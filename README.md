# PIC32MXBlinky #

Blink a LED on a PIC32MX250F256L dev board.
Just a simple dally-loop for now.

Later, we'll have:
- millisecond timer interrupt generated by Timer 1
- timer-driven main loop
- send characters to all five USARTs
- generate PWM on OC1 and OC2
- SPI channels configured to send data

## Connections ##

| Name | Port | Pin | Activity         |
|------|------|-----|------------------|
| LED  | RB9  | 33  | LED, active-LOW  |

PIC32 pin numbers are for the 100-pin package.

LED lights when the pin is pulled LOW.

## PIC32 Toolchain ##

MPLAB X V3.45 and 'xc32' V2.15.
These are quite old versions now, so I really ought to upgrade!

## PIC32 Programmer ##

Microchip ICD3.
Other programmers should work, e.g. ICD4 or PICkit4.
