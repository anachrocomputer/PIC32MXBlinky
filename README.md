# PIC32MXBlinky #

Blink a LED on a PIC32MX250F256L dev board.
Main loop timing by millisecond timer interrupt generated by Timer 1.
500Hz square wave on RD11, pin 71.
LED on RB9, pin 33, blinks at 1Hz.

Later, we'll have:
- send characters to all five USARTs
- generate PWM on OC1 and OC2
- SPI channels configured to send data

## Connections ##

| Name   | Port | Pin | Activity         |
|:-------|:-----|:----|:-----------------|
| LED    | RB9  | 33  | LED, active-LOW  |
| SQWAVE | RD11 | 71  | 500Hz            |

PIC32 pin numbers are for the 100-pin package.

LED lights when the pin is pulled LOW.

## PIC32 Toolchain ##

MPLAB X V3.45 and 'xc32' V2.15.
These are quite old versions now, so I really ought to upgrade!

## PIC32 Programmer ##

Microchip ICD3.
Other programmers should work, e.g. ICD4 or PICkit4.
